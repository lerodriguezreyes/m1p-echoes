Up ahead you see 3 marked doors with notes. At your right you spot a bowie knife pinning 2 loose sheets of paper. The handwriting on the paper seems familiar. The first note reads: Hi me. Yeah, this is weird. I’m taking to myself here. It’s a weird situation. If it’s any consolation this is not the first time you’ve been here! As best as we gather, this has happened before. Hell, I’d bet it’s been going on ever since ol’ Dustin disappeared. Long story short, Dustin's warning is real and we’re picking up the slack after he went on break. So yeah, we’re stuck here trying to bootstrap a solution from stuff we’ve cobbled up together. We're so close to figuring this out."</div>
